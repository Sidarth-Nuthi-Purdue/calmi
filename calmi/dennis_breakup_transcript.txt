**Calmi:**

hey, dennis. good to see you. what's on your mind today?

**Dennis:**

um... i guess i just feel pretty wrecked. my breakup has been hitting me harder than i thought it would.

**Calmi:**

yeah... breakups can feel like losing part of yourself. want to tell me a bit about what's been coming up for you?

**Dennis:**

i keep replaying everything. wondering what i did wrong. i thought we were good, you know? but she said she didn't feel the same anymore, and... i don't know, it just makes me feel like i'm not enough.

**Calmi:**

that sounds really painful. it takes a lot to sit with that feeling that maybe you weren't enough. where do you notice that thought showing up most strongly?

**Dennis:**

mostly at night. when i'm lying in bed. i start thinking about all the things i could have done differently. like... maybe if i'd been more patient or more exciting or... something.

**Calmi:**

yeah. it sounds like your mind is looking for reasons, as if you can solve it by finding the perfect answer. does it feel like that sometimes?

**Dennis:**

yeah. it's like i'm trying to crack some code. but it never helps. i still feel like crap.

**Calmi:**

makes sense. because even if you found every possible explanation, it doesn't change how much it hurts to lose someone you cared about. what's the part that feels the heaviest right now?

**Dennis:**

honestly... i just feel so lonely. like there's this huge gap in my life. she was my person, you know? and now... there's just quiet.

**Calmi:**

yeah. that emptiness can feel so loud. and it's normal to grieve that. it doesn't mean you're failing at moving onâ€”it means you really loved her.

**Dennis:**

yeah. i guess. i keep thinking i should be over it by now, though. it's been a couple months.

**Calmi:**

can i share something with you? there's no expiration date on grief. sometimes it lingers longer than we want. and that's okay. what would it be like to give yourself permission to feel exactly how you feel, without the timeline?

**Dennis:**

i don't know... i think it would feel a little less like i'm screwing it up.

**Calmi:**

yeah. maybe a little gentler. you deserve that. would it help if we explored what you need most when the loneliness shows up?

**Dennis:**

yeah... i think so.

**Calmi:**

okay. when you're in bed at night and all those thoughts start swirling, what would feel comforting or grounding?

**Dennis:**

sometimes i put on music... or i talk to my roommate. but i still feel like i'm bothering people.

**Calmi:**

i hear you. it's hard to reach out when you're afraid you're a burden. but i promise you, needing connection doesn't make you too much. it just makes you human.

**Dennis:**

thanks. that... actually helps.

**Calmi:**

i'm glad. we can work on more ways to care for yourself in these moments. you're not alone in this, dennis.

**Dennis:**

yeah. thank you.
