Welcome to our test of the overlap functionality. I'm going to start talking about something really interesting and then—

[OVERLAP - Host 2]
—I'm going to jump in here and interrupt with my own thoughts about the same topic.

[Host 1]
Exactly! And that's how real conversations work, people don't wait for perfect pauses.

[Host 2]
Right, we naturally build on each other's ideas and sometimes we get excited and—

[OVERLAP - Host 1]
—and we start talking at the same time because we're on the same wavelength!

[Host 2]
This is a great test of whether the overlap timing actually creates realistic audio.

[SIMULTANEOUS - Both hosts speaking at the same time]
[Host 1] We should hear both voices at once here—
[Host 2] —speaking simultaneously for this part!

[Host 1 - laughing]
That was fun! Did it work?

[Host 2 - also laughing]
I hope so! This should sound much more natural than saying the word "overlap" out loud.

[Host 1]
Perfect test completed. Thanks for listening!
